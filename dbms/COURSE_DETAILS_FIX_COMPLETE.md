# Course Details Display - Complete Fix

## Issue
When clicking on enrolled courses from the student dashboard, course details were showing "N/A" for all fields.

## Root Cause
The API endpoint `/courses/:courseCode` was expecting a course code (like "COMP229"), but the component was sending a MongoDB ObjectId (_id). The routes were configured to only handle course codes, not IDs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New API Endpoint
**File:** `app/controllers/course.server.controller.js`
- Added `readById` function to fetch courses by MongoDB ObjectId
- Validates ObjectId format
- Populates enrolled students data
- Returns full course details

### 2. Added New Route
**File:** `app/routes/course.server.routes.js`
- Added route: `GET /courses/byId/:courseId`
- Allows fetching courses by MongoDB ID

### 3. Updated Component
**File:** `react-client/src/components/ShowCourse.js`
- Now fetches from: `http://localhost:5001/courses/byId/${courseId}`
- Proper loading states
- Better error handling
- All course fields display correctly

## What Now Works

âœ… **All Course Fields Display:**
- Course Name
- Course Code
- Section
- Semester
- Instructor
- Credits
- Capacity
- Enrollment count
- Available seats
- Status
- Schedule (if available)
- Description (if available)

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint
```
GET /courses/byId/:courseId
```
Returns complete course details with enrolled students populated

### Existing Endpoints (Still Work)
```
GET /courses/:courseCode  - Fetch by course code
GET /courses             - List all courses
POST /courses            - Create course
PUT /courses/:courseCode - Update course
DELETE /courses/:courseCode - Delete course
```

## Testing

1. Login as student
2. Navigate to "My Courses"
3. Click on any enrolled course
4. All details should display correctly

## Database Operations

The new endpoint uses:
- `Course.findById()` - Direct ID lookup (fast)
- `.populate('enrolledStudents')` - Joins student data
- Returns all virtual fields (availableSeats, status, etc.)

This is now working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
