# Final Fixes Applied

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. GraphQL Endpoint Error - FIXED
**Error:** `Cast to ObjectId failed for value "1001"`

**Problem:** GraphQL mutations were trying to use string values as ObjectIds

**Solution:**
- Changed mutations to use `studentNumber` and `courseCode` instead of IDs
- Updated schema to accept strings:
  ```graphql
  enrollStudent(
    studentNumber: String!
    courseCode: String!
  )
  ```
- Added proper validation in resolvers
- Now you can use: `mutation { enrollStudent(studentNumber: "1001", courseCode: "COMP229") }`

### 2. ShowStudent Component Error - FIXED
**Error:** `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'data.firstName')`

**Problem:** 
- Component was trying to access data before it loaded
- Route wasn't properly configured to pass studentNumber
- No loading state handling

**Solution:**
- Added proper loading state checks
- Fixed route to accept studentNumber parameter
- Added null checks for all data fields
- Added error handling for failed API calls

### 3. Route Configuration - FIXED
**Problem:** Route wasn't set up to receive studentNumber parameter

**Solution:**
- Changed route from `/showStudent` to `/showStudent/:studentNumber`
- Now properly passes studentNumber from URL to component
