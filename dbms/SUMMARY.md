## 📊 Database Heavy Operations Analysis

### Identified Heavy Operations:

1. **Student Enrollment** (Medium Impact)
   - Updates both Course and Student documents
   - Two database writes per enrollment
   - Location: `app/controllers/enrollment.server.controller.js`

2. **Loading Students with Courses** (High Impact)
   - Uses `.populate()` which does join-like operations
   - Can be slow with many students
   - Location: `app/controllers/student.server.controller.js:42`

3. **Course Enrollment Status** (High Impact)
   - Loads all students for a course
   - Multiple database queries
   - Location: `app/controllers/enrollment.server.controller.js:174`

4. **Enrollment Statistics** (Medium Impact)
   - Aggregate operations on every request
   - No caching implemented
   - Location: `app/models/course.server.model.js:111`

### Recommended Optimizations:

1. **Add Caching** 
   - Cache enrollment statistics for 5-10 minutes
   - Use Redis or in-memory cache

2. **Add Indexes**
   ```javascript
   CREATE INDEX idx_enrolled ON courses(enrolledStudents);
   CREATE INDEX idx_student_enrolled ON students(enrolledCourses);
   ```

3. **Implement Pagination**
   - Don't load all students at once
   - Use cursor-based pagination

4. **Consider Separate Enrollments Collection**
   - Would eliminate embed/embed relationship
   - Better for analytics
   - Allows additional metadata

## 🗄️ Database Normalization Status

### Current Schema (NoSQL Appropriate)

#### Students Collection
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String (unique),
  studentNumber: String (unique),
  password: String,
  role: String (student/admin),
  enrolledCourses: [ObjectId refs to Courses],
  totalCredits: Number
}
```

#### Courses Collection
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  courseCode: String (unique),
  courseName: String,
  capacity: Number,
  enrolledStudents: [ObjectId refs to Students],
  instructor: String,
  credits: Number
}
```

### Normalization Notes:
✅ **Currently appropriate for MongoDB**
- Embedded arrays (enrolledCourses, enrolledStudents) are MongoDB best practice
- Follows NoSQL document model
- Not a relational database, so doesn't need 3NF

⚠️ **For full normalization:**
- Would create separate Enrollments collection
- See `database-normalization.sql` for details

## 🔧 GraphQL Endpoint Usage

### Access
URL: `http://localhost:5001/graphql`

### Basic Query Examples

#### Get All Students
```graphql
query {
  students {
    firstName
    lastName
    studentNumber
    totalCredits
    enrolledCourses {
      courseCode
      courseName
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get All Courses
```graphql
query {
  courses {
    courseCode
    courseName
    enrollmentCount
    capacity
    availableSeats
    status
  }
}
```

#### Enroll Student
```graphql
mutation {
  enrollStudent(
    studentId: "student_id"
    courseId: "course_id"
  )
}
```

### Applications:
- ✅ Mobile app backend
- ✅ Admin dashboard data fetching
- ✅ Real-time analytics
- ✅ Third-party integrations
- ✅ Custom reports

See `GraphQL_Usage_Guide.md` for complete documentation.
