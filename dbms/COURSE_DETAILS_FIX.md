# Course Details Display Fix

## Issue Fixed
When students click on enrolled courses, the course details page wasn't showing course information properly.

## Problem
The `ShowCourse` component was rendering before data finished loading, causing "Course Name: undefined" and other fields showing as blank.

## Solution Applied

### Changes to ShowCourse.js:

1. **Added proper loading state handling**
   - Shows spinner while data is loading
   - Only renders content once data is available

2. **Improved data fetching**
   - Added try-catch error handling
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Proper async/await implementation

3. **Enhanced display**
   - Better layout with Card component
   - Shows all course fields with proper null checks
   - Displays enrollment information (capacity, enrolled count, available seats)
   - Shows schedule if available
   - Shows description if available

4. **Better UI**
   - Two-column layout for course info
   - Clear section headers
   - Professional styling
   - Proper back button functionality

## What Now Works

✅ **Course Name** - Displays properly  
✅ **Course Code** - Displays properly  
✅ **Section** - Displays properly  
✅ **Semester** - Displays properly
